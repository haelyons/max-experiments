## Notes
- Careful use of the max voices counter recommended, 16 voices uses ~32% CPU on my Mac, and 32 voices uses over 100%, breaks audio, and can crash Ableton :)
- Requires Max 8.2.0 or above for support of the `live.adsrui` object. Note this UI element is useful but indvidual ADSR parameters can be controlled via number objects
